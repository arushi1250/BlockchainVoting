# BlockchainVoting

Security of digital voting is always the biggest concern when considering to implement a digitalvoting system. With such monumental decisions at stake, there can be no doubt about the systemâ€™s ability to secure data and defend against potential attacks. One way the security issues can be potentially solved is through the technology of blockchains.

Blockchain technology originates from the underlying architectural design of the crypto currency bitcoin. It is a form of distributed database where records take the form of transactions, a block is a collection of these transactions. With the use of blockchains a secure and robust system for digital voting can be devised.

To solve the problem, I propose a way to use the blockchain to ensure the features of the decentralized voting. The blockchain technology is characterized by decentralization, irreversibility, distribution of joint accounting, asymmetric encryption and data-security.
